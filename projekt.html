      <h1 class="center_text">Low poly character</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Im making a Low poly character that have animations, they don't look like human, well they're half human let's say</h3>
      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <h3>CSS</h3>

      <h2>End User</h2>
      <h3>13-18 year old male, this game has jets that people reconzises in the modern days. people might want adventured type of gameplay, there are some characters from the most reconzised countries</h3>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Have legs and arms</h3>
      <h2>Specification</h2>
      <h3>Plane combined character</h3>
      <h3>Plane on the characters back</h3>

      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
      <h4>Nice overall design(for low poly stuff), smooth movement with reconizeble things. It is important since a badcharacter design and movement stuff might make the player quit. Make sure arms and legs are seprated control from the main body so it looks more realistic</h4> 
      <h3>Functionality</h3>
      <h4>Functionality is how the thing work properly, no bugs. I'll do that by code check, run, fix and repeat. If the it bug then no one will play it</h4>
      <h3>Usability</h3>
      <h4>Usability is how ez is the final projekt runs, smoothly or glitchy... and I will check this by checking the character, and the animations. The character need to look normal, not a leg on the head a arm stuck in the body...
